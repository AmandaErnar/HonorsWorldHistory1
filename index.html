      <p>Greek mythology is a collection of ancient stories about gods, goddesses, and heroes from ancient Greece.</p>
      <p>The myths explore universal themes such as love, jealousy, courage, and the consequences of human/divine actions. They provide a rich collection of stories that resonate across cultures, serving as a source of inspiration for literature, art, and popular culture. The  relevance of Greek mythology lies in its ability to capture the complexities of human nature, offering a mirror through which we can reflect on our own triumphs, challenges, and the eternal quest for meaning.</p>
