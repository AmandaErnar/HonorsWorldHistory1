        <p>Greek mythology provides captivating stories that not only entertain but also explain natural forces. For the ancient Greeks, thunder was Zeus's thunderbolt, and the seas' turmoil came from Poseidon's trident. The changing seasons were linked to Persephone's journey between the living and the underworld. These myths personified natural events, giving them purpose and meaning. Greeks used these stories to understand and connect with the powerful forces that shaped their world, turning the forces of nature into characters in a grand tale that bridged realms of mortality and divinity.</p>
